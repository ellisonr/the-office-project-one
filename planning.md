# Planning

## Initial thoughts

-  I initally wanted it to be a regular trivia page, but now I want it to be a Dundies themed quiz.
-  Unlike my first version of this trivia, I want the questions to be shown individually.
-  Have the first page be explaining what the game is about
-  Offer the player to play the trivia based on seasons 1-5 or seasons 6-9
-  Self-scoring + have a message based on how well or poorly the player did
-  Make the color scheme the light blue/cyan that is seen on most The Office memorabilia/boxes/dvd covers; also add some hints of red
-  Use pictures of each character next to their names
